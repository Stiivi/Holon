/// The concept of holon is described as follows:
///
/// - holon is a sub-graph defined by nodes that belong to the holon
/// - holons owns all children nodes
/// - holons are organised in a tree structure: a holon has child holons
///   and might have a parent
/// - holons do not share nodes
/// - holon is a regular node in a graph and connections to/from a holon
///   can be formed
/// - when a holon is removed from a graph, all its children nodes are
///   removed as well, including child holons and their nodes
