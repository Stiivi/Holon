//  Created by Stefan Urbanek on 2021/10/5.

// NOTE: Repurposed from the TarotKit. Changes to design should be kept in sync.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// IMPORTANT: This is the core structure of this framework. Be very considerate
//            when adding new functionality. If functionality can be achieved
//            by using existing functionality, then add it to an extension
//            (file Holon+Convenience or similar). Optimisation is not
//            a reason to add functionality here at this moment.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------


/// Holon is a mutable structure representing a directed labelled multi-graph.
/// The graph is composed of nodes (vertices) and links (edges between
/// vertices).
///
/// The main functionality of the graph structure is to mutate the graph:
/// ``Graph/add(_:)``, ``Graph/connect(from:to:attributes:)-372gc``.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let graph = Graph()
///
/// let parent = Node()
/// graph.add(parent)
///
/// let leftChild = Node()
/// graph.add(leftChild)
/// graph.connect(from: parent, to: leftChild, at: "left")
///
/// let rightChild = Node()
/// graph.add(rightChild)
/// graph.connect(from: parent, to: leftChild, at: "right")
/// ```
///
/// ## Lifetime and Ownership of Nodes and Links
///
/// When a node is created, it belongs to the creator until the node
/// is added to the graph. When a node is added to the graph using
/// ``Graph/add(_:)-3j4hi`` then the graph becomes owner of the node until the
/// node is removed from the graph with ``Graph/remove(_:strategy:)``.
///
/// Link, when created externally, is owned by the creator. When a link is added
/// to the graph using ``Graph/add(_:)-af7w`` or a new link is created by
/// ``Graph/connect(from:to:labels:id:)`` then graph becomes owner of the
/// link until the link is removed from the graph either with
/// ``Graph/disconnect(link:)`` or as a by-product of ``Graph/remove(_:strategy:)``.
