// IMPORTANT: This is the core structure of this framework. Be very considerate
//            when adding new functionality. If functionality can be achieved
//            by using existing functionality, then add it to an extension
//            (file Graph+Convenience or similar). Optimisation is not
//            a reason to add functionality here at this moment.

/// Graph is a mutable structure representing a directed labelled multi-graph.
/// The graph is composed of nodes (vertices) and links (edges between
/// vertices).
///
/// The main functionality of the graph structure is to mutate the graph:
/// ``Graph/add(_:)``, ``Graph/connect(from:to:attributes:)-372gc``.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let graph = Graph()
///
/// let parent = Node()
/// graph.add(parent)
///
/// let leftChild = Node()
/// graph.add(leftChild)
/// graph.connect(from: parent, to: leftChild, at: "left")
///
/// let rightChild = Node()
/// graph.add(rightChild)
/// graph.connect(from: parent, to: leftChild, at: "right")
/// ```
///
/// - Remark: This is a "domain specific problem environment object", or a
/// "simulation environment". It is not made a generic as it is not intended
/// for general purpose use. It does not mean it might not change in the future.
